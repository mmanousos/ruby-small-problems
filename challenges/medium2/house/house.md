in: none
out: full rhyme

method: `recite` returns formatted string.

provided `pieces`: nested arrays with ordered portions of the rhyme

each section needs to start with "This is " and the line "the house that Jack built." (terminating with a point)

based on the `pieces`, we iterate from the end of the array and move forward with each iteration.
each subsequent subarray adds the first element, then a line break, and appends the second element to the front of the existing line.

AL:
"This is " + pieces[-1] + "."
"This is " + pieces[-2][0] + "\n" + pieces[-2][1] + pieces[-1] + "."

SET result = []
iterate from the back of the array (reverse.each) (reverse_each.with_index)
  if subarray.size == 1
    result << "This is " + subarray + "."
  else
    SET current = -1 element from result index
    at index 8 of current, insert next subarray[0] + "\n" + subarray[1]    
    result << current
  end
  result << "\n\n" unless index == pieces.size - 1
end
result
