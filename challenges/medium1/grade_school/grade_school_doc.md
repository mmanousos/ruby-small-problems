Write a small archiving program that stores students' names along with the grade that they are in.

In the end, you should be able to:

Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
"Add Jim to grade 2."
"OK."
Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
"Which students are in grade 2?"
"We've only got Jim just now."

Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.

{1=>["Anna", "Barb", "Charlie"], 2=>["Alex", "Peter"], ...}

The exact output format doesn't matter: what's important is that it shows all of the students and grades in the proper order.

Note that all our students only have one name. (It's a small town, what do you want?)

Problem
Students have names (first names only)
Students are sorted into their appropriate grades alphabetically
Grades are represented by integers

add method: adds a student to their class by using grade (number) and name
students method: returns students in a specific grade
all students method: returns students grouped by grade, listed alphabetically

We don't know what grades we will have
Do we need to have place holder for empty classes? 

Example / Tests


Data Structure
hash for full school
key: integer for grade  
value: array for student names
