# 5. Launch School Printer (Part 1)
=begin
Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric input is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the scope of this exercise.

Examples:

$ ruby lsprint.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!

$ ruby lsprint.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!

=end

input = nil

loop {
	puts ">> How many times should I print? Please enter a number >= 3:"
	input = gets.chomp.to_i
 	break if input >= 3
	puts ">> I need a higher number please."
}

input.times { puts 'Launch School is the best!' }
