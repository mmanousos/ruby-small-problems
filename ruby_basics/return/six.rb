6. Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 6)
What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This method call will only print the string 'Breakfast' because the explicit return prevents the rest of the method from being accessed.
