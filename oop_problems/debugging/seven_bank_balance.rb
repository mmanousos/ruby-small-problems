# Bank Balance
# We created a simple BankAccount class with overdraft protection, that does
# not allow a withdrawal greater than the amount of the current balance. We
# wrote some example code to test our program. However, we are surprised by
# what we see when we test its behavior. Why are we seeing this unexpected
# output? Make changes to the code so that we see the appropriate behavior.

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(account_number, client)
    @account_number = account_number
    @client = client
    @balance = 0
  end

  def deposit(amount)
    # if amount > 0
    if valid_transaction?(amount)
      self.balance += amount
      "$#{amount} deposited. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter a positive amount."
    end
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    # if amount > 0 && balance > amount
    if valid_transaction?(amount) && balance > amount
      success = (self.balance -= amount)
    else
      success = false
    end

    if success
      "$#{amount} withdrawn. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($#{balance})."
    end
  end

  def balance=(new_balance)
    if valid_transaction?(new_balance)
      @balance = new_balance
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end

  def valid_transaction?(new_balance)
    new_balance > 0
  end
end

# Example

account = BankAccount.new('5538898', 'Genevieve')

                          # Expected output:
p account.balance         # => 0
p account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
p account.withdraw(80)    # => Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($50).
p account.balance         # => 50

# Code as it is written does not assess whether there are sufficient funds
# before attempting to withdraw the amount.
#
# If using the `valid_transaction?` method as written, then should implement it
# in both `deposit` and `withdraw` methods instead of using direct comparison
# (as originally written).
#
# The main change is that the `withdraw` method needs to also check that
# `balance` is greater than `amount` before deducting.

Course Solution
class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance # Is it that we only have a reader here, no writer method?

  def initialize(account_number, client)
    @account_number = account_number

    @balance = 0

      self.balance += amount
      "$#{amount} deposited. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter a positive amount."
    end
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    if amount > 0 && valid_transaction?(balance - amount)
      self.balance -= amount
      "$#{amount} withdrawn. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else

p account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50

in the method body?

The return value will be the mutated argument.
