# Sorting Distances
# When attempting to sort an array of various lengths, we are surprised to see
# that an ArgumentError is raised. Make the necessary changes to our code so
# that the various lengths can be properly sorted and line 62 produces the
# expected output.

# Example

puts [Length.new(1, :mi), Length.new(1, :nmi), Length.new(1, :km)].sort
# => comparison of Length with Length failed (ArgumentError)
# expected output:
# 1 km
# 1 nmi
# 1 mi

# Because Array#sort utilizes the <=> combined comparison method, we need to
# define one for our class in order for the sort method call to execute as
# expected.

# I originally mixed in the Comparable module as well but it was not necessary
# for this problem. However, according to the Course Solution, its inclusion
# along with the now defined `<=>` method allows us to remove all the previously
# defined comparison methods (==, <=, >, etc.).

# Further Exploration
# Working with floating point numbers always involves imprecision. For example,
# you might observe the following:

Length.new(10, :km).as_nautical_miles.as_kilometers == Length.new(10, :km) # => false
# This is because converting 10 kilometers to nautical miles and then to
# kilometers again yields a result of 10.0001.

# This is why tests of methods that involve floating point numbers often don't 
# check equality but equality within a certain delta. For example, we could
# write a test like the following (assuming that we also implement arithmetic
# methods like Length#-):

(Length.new(10, :km).as_nautical_miles.as_kilometers - Length.new(10, :km)).abs < 0.001 # => true
