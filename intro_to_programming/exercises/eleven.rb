# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# This exercise is really vague.
# If we are supposed to look at the ruby-doc.com documentation, why not just specify that?
# And as folks new to Ruby, are there other places we might look for API sources?
# I would find a bit more guidance helpful in what makes an API source good (to help determine a favorite).

I appreciate the Abbrev Module (Library) for its built in ability to generate a set of appropriate abbreviations that will still map to the original key word.
