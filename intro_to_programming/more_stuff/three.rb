# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling is defining actions for the program to take if an error (or exception) is encountered.
Using the reserved word "escape" allows us to establish additional steps to take at that juncture.
The program then continues after the "escape" condition is executed.
It prevents the program from exiting completely at the first error it encounters.
